# Analysis of the 2016 Central Italy Seismic Sequence via DBSCAN

**Course Project: Earthquake Physics and Machine Learning (Fall 2025)**
**Authors:** Francesco Ianni Ficorilli & Maria Elena Spinozzi

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect statistical precursors in the seismic catalog of Central Italy (2016 sequence).
We apply **DBSCAN clustering** to isolate fault systems (Amatrice vs. Visso/Norcia) and analyze the temporal evolution of the **b-value**.
